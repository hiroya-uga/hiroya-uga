### Thank you for working with me :tada:

- :bow: I don't usually use this account.
- :octocat: I use this account only when I am working as a staff member of my company on some private [GitHub Organization](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations) or contributing for public standards organizations.
- :sunglasses: If I actively commit to public repository or contribute to OSS, I'll use an anonymous [GitHub PRO](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/learning-about-github/githubs-products#github-pro) account.
