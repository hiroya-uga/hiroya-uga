### Thank you for working with me :tada:

:bow: I don't usually use this account.

:octocat: I use this account only when I am working as a staff member of my company on some private organization in GitHub.

:squirrel: If I actively commit to public repository or contribute to OSS, I'll use an anonymous pro account.
